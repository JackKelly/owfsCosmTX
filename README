Very simple script for sending data from a 1-wire network to Cosm
(formerly Pachube).

Requires owpython to be installed first: http://owfs.sourceforge.net/owpython.html

And also requires my little cosmSender module: https://github.com/JackKelly/cosmSender

To use, you need to create a config.xml file in the following format:

<config>
  <apikey>YOUR COSM API KEY</apikey>
  <feed>YOUR COSM FEED ID</feed>
</config>
